# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 3: June 27, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Just noticed my codepen is back to the initial state. I guess I forgot to save the page. (hmm). Built the structure. Did tutorials JS. Forked repo on GitHub and bult logfile. Downloaded bootstrap and studied scss.
**Thoughts** Github proved to be less difficult than expected. JS went well. I will make the tribute page in bootstrap but I think I will make the profile page without it. Learning bootstrap can wait till later

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the FCC tribute page. I have not spend more than an hour on the challenge (tired after a long day of making cloths withe the girls). Started the Javascript lessons of FCC. The lessons are going really well. :-)
**Thoughts**: I don't really see the point of using bootstrap with my current knowledge of css. And working with it in codepen means I have to override it or create additional classes to override the bootstrap css. However if I could copy the css and adapt it to my project at hand it could work. I don't know what the possibilities are but I intend to find out.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours and hours finishing the first lessons FCC on html and CSS and bootstrap.  Started looking at the first challenges: the tribut page and the portfolio. Made the rest of the arrangements. Getting an account on github and connecting to gitter.
**Thoughts:** I'm going really fast with these lessons due to my prior knowledge no doubt. I am a bit anxious about this gitter-twitter-github stuff and feeling somewhat overwhelmed by it. When I read the gitter comments I see I am not the only one.
