### Day 7 : January 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 1 hour Javascript. 
**Thoughts** One hour is hardly enough to get into the flow. Small succes did one slightly complex challenge (in three steps)  without example and managed to do this without help.

### Day 6 : January 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 0.5 hours Javascript. 
**Thoughts** Same story. Not much time today and tired after visitor. Did only half an hour but better than nothing at all.

### Day 4 : January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Moved my codepen code to GitHub to avoid shortcuts (in GitHub I'm forced to write also the code for html body head etc en link to bootstrap). Struggled with JS synthax. At a certain point I decided to write the code of every single JS challenge in my text-editor. 
**Thoughts** First writing the code in a text-editor instead of filling in the blanks will hopefully help me remembering the syntnax and the repetition will also work. JS gave me a bit of a headache. Will write the code of all tutorials in a separate file, also for reference when the real fun begins.

### Day 3: January 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Just noticed my codepen is back to the initial state. I guess I forgot to save the page. (hmm). Built the structure. Did tutorials JS. Forked repo on GitHub and bult logfile. Downloaded bootstrap and studied scss.
**Thoughts** Github proved to be less difficult than expected. JS went well. I will make the tribute page in bootstrap but I think I will make the profile page without it. Learning bootstrap can wait till later

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started the FCC tribute page. I have not spend more than an hour on the challenge (tired after a long day of making cloths withe the girls). Started the Javascript lessons of FCC. The lessons are going really well. :-)
**Thoughts**: I don't really see the point of using bootstrap with my current knowledge of css. And working with it in codepen means I have to override it or create additional classes to override the bootstrap css. However if I could copy the css and adapt it to my project at hand it could work. I don't know what the possibilities are but I intend to find out.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours and hours finishing the first lessons FCC on html and CSS and bootstrap.  Started looking at the first challenges: the tribut page and the portfolio. Made the rest of the arrangements. Getting an account on github and connecting to gitter.
**Thoughts:** I'm going really fast with these lessons due to my prior knowledge no doubt. I am a bit anxious about this gitter-twitter-github stuff and feeling somewhat overwhelmed by it. When I read the gitter comments I see I am not the only one.
